# PROJECT CLOSED #

Unfortunately, I don't have time to maintain the project, that's why I'm closing the project.

The last working version of FVTT that is supported by the module is 0.66.

# FVTT-Teleport
A module for FVTT to teleport tokens between two points

### Instalation
Manifest: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mascent/FVTT-Teleport/master/module.json

### Features
* TP config sheet has a new tap called Offsets in which the user can save offsets (as many as you want) for the token when they teleported to that TP. To use this feature just controlle a token or tokens an move it/them to the desire possition, then hit the capture button.
* The middle button of a mouse (wheel button) can be use to start a drag and drop workflow to teleport tokens, just controll a set of tokens, press the middle button and drag those tokens to a TP, once you drop the tokens over the TP those tokens will be teleported to the destination TP.
* A new setting flag was added to the foundry's config to hide tokens from the departed scene when they are teleported to a different scene.
* Added a button to the TP config sheet to highlight the offsets of the TP on the canvas as a visual help.

### How to Use it
## Adding a new Teleport Point (TP)
1. Go to the desire scene.
2. On the control bar select "Journal Notes" button. 
3. On the journal control bar, select the "Add Teleport Point" button.
4. Go to the desire location on the scene and hit double click with the left button of your mouse.
5. A message box will appear requesting the name for the teleport point, fill it out and the click continue.
6. The configuration form for the TP will appear. From here you can select the destination for the TP and the offset for the arrival.
7. Once everything is filled out click on "Update Note" to save the TP. A new note map will be added to the scene as well a new journal entry will be added under the "Teleport      Points" folder

## Modifying a Teleport Point (TP)
1. Do a double right click over the desire TP.
2. The configuration form for the TP will appear.
3. Do all the desire modifications, once you are done click the "Update Note" button.

## Deleting a Teleport Point (TP)
1. On the control bar select "Journal Notes" button.
2. Select the note that you want to delete. (orange border will appear over the note icon)
3. Hit the delete key on the keyboard. The icon will be removed from the scene as well as the journal entry associated with the TP.

## Triggering a Teleport Point (TP)
There are 3 ways to trigger a TP, those are:
1. Using the arrows keys from the keyboard. When you move a token with the keyboard over a TP, the TP will be triggered and all controlled tokens will be teleported to the          destination point.
2. With a double left click. When you double left click over a TP, the TP will be triggered and all controlled tokens will be teleported to the destination point.
3. With a drag & drop using the middle button of a mouse. When you drag a token with the middle button and then drop it over a TP, the TP will be triggered and all controlled      tokens will be teleported to the destination point.

### Consideration
* These are the permission needed for a PC to successfully interact with a TP:
  - Journal Entry associated with TP --> GM needs to grant "Observer" permission to the PC
  - Teleport tokens between scenes --> GM needs to grant the "Create New Tokens" permission to the Player role.
* To see note on a scene you need:
  - Have access to the journal entries associeted with the notes you want your PCs to see.
  - Toogle the "Notes Display" button on the Journal control bar.
